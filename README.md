# dama_dictionary_parser

This is a simple script to parse out the terms and definitions from the DAMA Dictionary of Data Management 2nd Ed. This script requires that you purchase the original PDF of the book.

I wrote and used this script somewhat quickly so that I could create flashcards to study for the  Certified Data Management Professionals (CDM)P exam. I hope it is useful to someone else.
